complete the tests for all the positive flows and the negative flows in:
https://github.com/qa191120/22.04.2021/blob/main/tdd/MyPositive10mulStackTest.java

implement the class in:
https://github.com/qa191120/22.04.2021/blob/main/tdd/MyPositive10mulStack.java
if a method throws a test, then add it to the interface
- do not forget to implement the logic that only positive number which can be divided by 10 without reminder could be
inserted into the stack. if a different number tries to be inserted- throw an exception

now the tests should work!
if a test does not work- fix the class code
